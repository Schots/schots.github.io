This blog is an exercise to learn and share everything related to systems powered by Machine Learning. The heuristic here is : DonÂ´t talk about deep learning or a spark cluster before showing me that you tried awk for data collection and a linear model to process everything. 

My name is Maykon Schots, an engineer from Brazil. 

Glad you came here.
